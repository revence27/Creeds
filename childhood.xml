</introduction>
<!--
     Fideism 
     Faces and voices
     Absolute dependence and rest
     Watch-and-learn (life apprenticeship)
     Instinctual (i.e., not catechised, not revealed, but inborn)
     “The Father” (i.e., Childhood Theology is *a* Christian Theology, this being basically Christianity Theory)
     “Knowledge of good and evil.”
     Grace and anti-legalism (which is different from antinomism)
     Naïve (because instinctual); can be fooled by premature evidentialism, which is what erases it as we grow up.
     Simple stories.
     Different from natural theology, which is imperfect. Childhood Theology is perfect.
     From the lips of babes, He hath perfected praise.
     Sense of wonder
     **
     The Son was historically a mystery hidden from the foundation of the World.
     But God repeatedly teaches humanity, culturally, to watch and wait for the Son of God, by whom they will again be children of God.
     While much remains a mystery, we have shown that all babies are perfectly Christian, and go to heaven when they die, like all true believers.

    Realistic-idealist social governance
      Humans will chase ideals, including ideal societies. This is normal Adam, by God’s good intention. Just as we like a fuck, we like utopia. That in both cases we tend to wrap the thing in murder and deceit is entirely true, entirely due to the Fall, and entirely beside the point.
      Since we, too, will surely aim for an ideal (whatever our opinions are, right or wrong) just as surely as we will fuck, and since will surely build a culture just as surely as we will raise children (whatever our opinions are, good or bad).
      The real grace for culture that is contained in the Gospel is this revelation of the fallen nature, and how it frees us from having to try for an ideal—having convinced us that we cannot attain it.
      Christianity looks down on this passing and decaying World. Our kingdom is not of this World. And this spontaneous death of the carnal, Earth-bound idealism is the birth into the Kingdom of God. We know that here the leaders will always be corrupt power-drunk mass-murderers who lie and cheat, filled with insatiable greed and lust. Even if we were to find that we are political by inclination, and we could not resist involving ourselves in this World of murderers, because our flesh is weak and we collapse before the lust and avarice that characterises politics, let us be like the shrewd manager in the Lord’s Parable, and take of whatever we get from that world and deposit it at the feet of Jesus Christ. Then one will say “Didn’t Moses teach that “the proceeds of prostitution shall not be brought as a gift to the Lord’?” And I will answer: “Have you not heard what the Lord Himself said of the prostitute who kissed His feet, washed them with tears and precious perfumes, and then dried them with her hair? —And didn’t the Lord commend her as one who would be remembered wherever the Gospel went? —And didn’t Judas Ischariot come out the worse for it, thinking himself more pious than the Holy Spirit?” Wherefore if we bear arms for an ideal, because we are political and fallen human politics has this sinful bloodlust of war and arms in the centre of it, let us bear arms Christianly, as followers of Christ doing what that means. (Armed-defensive-pacifist)
    The nature of fallen man
      The nature of fallen kings
        The nature of fallen governments
    The idolatry of Jesus-free utopias, and the poison of them.
    Only Jesus can govern well. Everybody else is a corrupt and murdering thief in actuality or in potentiality. Opportunity is all that lacks for the rest of us.

    Nunc-millenial eschatology
    Infra-dominionist
      There is a danger in dominion theology, in that it becomes of the World, rather than being just in the World.
      Infra-dominionist just seeks to identify small communities and societies as the sole property of Jesus Christ alone, due to their being Christian by confession (see Christianity Theory).
      Infra-dominion is simpler, as it starts with one life. Jesus gets Lordship over that life, and that life cedes to Him all that it controls.
      The only natural hierarchy is: Parent-child. It is the only one that God expects full respect for. The rest are only temporary, transient, decaying, less-legitimate, and prone to creeping irrelevance.
        Excluding their parents, Christians may rightfully refuse to recognise all other non-Christian authority.
        Christian social sovereignty—in other words, the society having an official religion, and that religion being Christian—is a state that for most of Christianity’s history was taken for granted. In those societies, accepting a non-Christian leader is entirely unthinkable.
        Christians should seek Christian social sovereignty, which means focussing whatever political activity they have—big or small—in favour of the sovereignty of Christianity. If a Christian, then, is a head of state, that state should be officially confessionally Christian.
    Dioptic eschatology
      Useful suspense
    The time is coming when the saints will be hunted down like pests and slaughtered like animals.
      Arms, war, suicidal pacifism
      Legitimate executing authority
        If there is legitimate execution in the eyes of a Christian, there is also illegitimate.
        Christians ought to fight injustice, and this includes injustice towards Christians.
        It is understood to be wicked abandonment of the victims of crime, murder, and genocide when we commend their death as the will of God, as martyrdom, and we do nothing about it. Certainly in many cases we go to the aid of those who suffer, and we even deploy violence in the defence of our property and lives, and those of others, even those of strangers. Yet seemingly for Christians we welcome all manner of violence as somehow proper. This particular heresy of suicidal pacifism and the attendant martyrdom apathy just may achieve the destruction of the body of Christ in a way no other heresy ever quite managed.
        Since the Christian will be killed by this World anyway, sooner or later, you or your descendants, does it matter if he is killed with a machete in a genocide, due to his suicidal pacifist philosophy, or with bullets from an executioner or soldier because of his armed-defensive-pacifist philosophy?
        There is an idea that the death of the appeasing coward is somehow more-precious to God than death in armed battle. “Precious in the eyes of God is the death of His saints.” Psalms 116!
        The dioptic eschatological teaching of Jesus Christ insists that the time is now to form armed-defensive-pacifist Christian communities, whether you believe that it will soon turn even worse for Christians (because that is what heralds the soon return of our Lord), or that we are in for another long wait as the Spirit purifies the bride (to make her ready for the wedding whose day and hour nobody knows), still the first step is to make life secure for confessing Christians. Armed-defensive-pacifist.

<!--
     Structured XML for creeds. Enables referencing particular parts of Scripture from specific points in the creeds. Enables a commentary to be generated from this and automatically typeset into a Bible for printing. A commentary-paired Bible is what I am hoping to manage, with the commentary being creedal in nature (based on creeds, generating creeds). This XML has to work together with certain scripts which will enable correction, testing, reformatting, and orderly changing of the structure of this book.

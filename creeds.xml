     Structured XML for creeds. Enables referencing particular parts of Scripture from specific points in the creeds. Enables a commentary to be generated from this and automatically typeset into a Bible for printing. A commentary-paired Bible is what I am hoping to manage, with the commentary being creedal in nature (based on creeds, generating creeds). This XML has to work together with certain scripts which will enable correction, testing, reformatting, and orderly changing of the structure of this book.

<introduction title="Christianity Theory">
  <dedication>
    For Revence Ruairidh Musana Kalibwani, by whom I understood the seriousness of <span class="gk">τον υιον αυτου τον μονογενη</span>, “his Son, the only-begotten.”
    <blockquote cite="St. Augustine">
      Surely what Cicero says comes straight from the heart of all fathers, when he wrote: “You are the only man of all men whom I would wish to surpass me in all things.”

          Book structure, implications.
          Creeds, commentary, scriptural references.
          Rulings—structures of responses to certain (rhetorical) questions—all of which, together, make up the Catechism of the book.
          Unique theology for a unique people. A systematic theology out of which answers can be got for all the questions a 21st century child could ever ask. We are only dealing with fundamental issues here: how to think, for instance, rather than how to think about X or what to decide about Y. This is not just “jurispudence.” It is a life theory. It is the axioms of the tradition of Christianity that preserves the truth. For this reason, then, this life theory is also Christianity theory. The “rulings” provided show how this theory could be used in real life by a suitably-Spirit-filled individual to decide on a contemporary question.
          Volumes organised by creed, wherefore four volumes: Apostles’, Nicene, Syncretistic-Protestant, Post-Protestant. They would get bigger as they go.
          In the course, a lectionary for this theology.
          Why “theory” in “Christianity Theory”.

        christian
        protestant
        infra-calvinist presbyterian "There is no need to speculate about the will of God, even if we were confident that with the Scriptures we could do so successfully. Arminianism is an identical mistake in the opposite direction. (The correct answer doesn’t matter, in other words. Anyway a theology is only one part of the mystery of the Gospel, and now we all see through a glass darkly.) A Presbyterianism that doesn’t try to read God’s mind."
        wesleyan "The best development of infra-Calvinist Christianity."
        post-protestant "We all hold to sola scripturist traditions."
        non-normative rulings "We do not issue laws in our rulings, but rather classifications. Informative rulings just pronounce the correct Christian-Theoretical answer to inform the conscience of the sinner that he may seek grace, and to guide the decision of the saint that he may choose the better thing."
        legitimate mysticism "The irreducible individuality of each relationship with God. Everyone who has believed in the risen Christ has a gospel in him. Only Paul’s is canon and universal, but we all have one. Mysticism is the search for your gospel."
        septuagint "The Christian Bible"
        lxx "Christian scriptural mysticism: masorah, gemmatria, and other devices of fastidious textual transmission."
        canon-recognition "Axiomatic (constitutional) documents, and how faith in Scripture affects the Canon.”
        fideistic textual criticism "Critical texts and the revealed extremes of the discipline. LXX+(TR1894÷W•H): Septuagint for the Old Testament, the back-translated Textus Receptus 1894 for Christological witness, and the Westcott-Hort NT to represent the tradition of conservative glossing."
        creeds as third testament "The Evolving Testament"
        creationist
        anti-darwinian
        anti-evolutionary-creationist
        fideist
        fideism
        kierkegaard
        kierkegaardian
        anti-positivist
        gödelian deutero-rationalism "Faith as the Class in NBG set theory"
        kurt gödel
        abrahamic theism "The ancient philosophy of pure faith in the God of Genesis 18, and how it disables all expressions other than hope and love."
        abraham kuyper
        kuyper
        kuyperian
        christian-nationalist "The Christian constitutional republic, a first draft"

        counter-islamic

        exclusively-militia-based community defence
        exclusively-homestead-based social organisation "Organise the homestead, interface with the society"
        territorial christianity
        battle of dongola
        dongola
        makuria
        kingdom of makuria
        ecological cycles as the sacred scripture of natural theology
        anti-gmo
        anti-nuclear
        peak-oil realism
        post-peak-oil christianity "An eschatological-dioptic application of the Long Descent in Christian cultural planning"
        market economy is the human condition
        christian collectivism as also spontaneous fruit of the spirit
        anti-circumcision
        anti-abortion "We rule that what a mother recognises as abortion we recognise as murder."
        pro-monogamy
        pro-polygamy
        crucicentric anthropology "The best of man’s attempts to organise human society will be that whose leaders most submit to the teaching of Christianity. Probably not seen since Acts 4."
        dioptic eschatology "Exploiting the relevant suspence of Jesus Christ’s eschatological teaching to build fervent long-term Christian communities"
        culture-building "The 10 Elements of Homestead Culture: children, faithful marriage, family codex, security and defence provisions, food and housing provisions, arts, spoken language, written language, feasts"
        the homestead as God’s core ecclesia "Where two or three are gathered"
        the community "Free allied Christian homesteads."
        hermeneutics
        creedal hermeneutics "Using (and writing) creeds as tools for interpreting the Bible"
        dogmatics
        systematic theology "Consciously or not, life’s one assured product is this: a systematic theology."
        hymnology "Hymn as memorisable poetic sermon."
        hymnody "Designed around my Presbyterian hymnody"
        doxology "Designed around the Grace"
        liturgy "Designed around the Our Father"
        lectionary "Designed around the Gospels and the Acts."
        calendar and feast days "Contemporary Christian memorials and martyr roll"
        mystery martyrology "The patterns and spiritual lessons of Christian persecution"
        the Christianised week "The Lord’s Day (Sunday), Faith day (Monday), Martyrs’ day (Tuesday), Hope day (Wednesday), Grace day (Thursday), Pastoral Epistles day (Friday), Paulist Epistles day (Saturday)"
